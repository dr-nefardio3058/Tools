# The ng-app Directive

### The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.

_The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded._

# The ng-init Directive
### The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.

_Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead._

# The ng-model Directive
### The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

**The ng-model directive can also:**

* Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
* Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
* Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
* Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
